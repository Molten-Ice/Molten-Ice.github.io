          I forever resided in a state of dreaming paralysis; consuming my mind daily with eternal infatuation. Yet I wonder if it heightens my bliss, my future euphoria. Or simply diminishes my reality, rendering the future to prove insufficient. You associate yourself with insecurity, connotate with suffering. Is this your revenge? A trade for all you bring. Love. A word feeling insufficient, 4 letters to represent a lifetime of emotions...

          A sweet sound began to resonate through the halls.
          It was gentle, therapeutic like it could solve life’s most complicated faults in a single intonation. Yet it stood with prowess, its demeanour unmoving as it refused to be cast aside.

          “They had been designed to embody the ultimate form of art, a medium through which the gods could comprehend themselves. The god's goal had been to create mechanical beings so complicated they began to evolve, so intricate they could comprehend their own existence, a new lifeform that could only be known as biological.
