An occurrence which had been all too regular recently. My mind succumbing to a state of hyperactivity, reminiscing neural pathways less unturned for years, enveloping itself in a futuristic nostalgia for dreams which yet remained unfilled. Banishing any immediate attempt at sleep, only after hours of tossing and turning did I manage to accept sleep, finally finding comfort in my own bed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Until suddenly I awoke, seeing a silhouette lurking, entirely unwelcome in the familiarity of my room. Still lying in my bed, my almost pitch black surroundings only saved by a few stray rays of moonlight. Wanting to illuminate this figure, prove to my myself it was nothing more than an illusion. I reach for for the light switch, but my body remains stationary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I try again to shift my body, attempt to justify the last failure by fatigue, but again, my body fails me. Trapped underneath my covers, unable to escape. The greatest claustrophobia beginning to manifest itself. I attempt to twitch my fingers, urging them to move with every fibre of my mind, but they remain persistent, unresponsive and unmoved. Paralysed. I felt suffocated, abandoned by my own mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I want to run, I want to scream, I want to cry, but even air refuses to leave my lungs. I am left frozen, less in control than a statue, forced to endure whatever this figment of my half subconscious mind throws at me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I feel something brush against my back. I want to squirm, I want to be able to turn and face it. Anything. All I want in this instant is to be free, not from the confines of society or some grand monumento, only a much less magnificent goal, free within my own mind, have it ability to think restored. My most basic human right has been stripped from me, and I am left within a way to retrieve it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I am left here frozen. Confined in this nightmare without a way to escape, forced to endure its wrath, without limits. Suddenly the figure charges towards me, lunging over my bed. I want to shield myself with my arms but even they are unwilling to move. The next moment the illusion instantly ceases, my racing heart palpitations only highlighting how real it was to me. I can only feel intense relief, entirely thankfully it is over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Attempting to cherish this newfound freedom, and process what has happened, I once again reach for the light switch, seeking to find comfort in the illuminated room, where no illusion can lurk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then suddenly it hits me. My arm is, once again, unwilling to move. Still frozen, stuck in a seemingly indefinite state of paralysis. My own mind stripped of its freedom, polluted by this curse. I attempt to find a inconsistency, any definite mistake that will prove this is nothing more than an illusion, and bring my mind back to reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The room surrounding me was no fantasy, as far as I could understand it perfectly replicated the very room I fell asleep in. Yet its ambience felt unnatural, an entire side of the room lay empty, horribly uncanny, sickening in every way, yet I could not comprehend why, my mind preventing me from deciphering the cause. A room beyond familiarity, a room had witnessed thousands of times, a room I had grown through my childhood in, now a stranger to me. I was in need of my memory now more than ever, yet it was now it decided to fail me, the greatest amnesia, feeling like a stranger in my own mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I had found the inconsistency, the room&#39;s layout was wrong, yet try as I might, I couldn&#39;t explain it. My mind restricting my own thoughts from me, as if it was forbidden knowledge. My mind unwilling to let me obtain irrefutable proof, instead forcing, and choosing, to make me endure the confines of this paralysis, suffocating me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This wasn&#39;t how it was supposed to go. I should be relaxing in the comfort of my own bed, bathing in its familiarity. Yet that feels the most distance possibility in this moment, instead only despair feels inevitable. Stripping me of all belief, leaving in a state of hopeless, wishing my bed would swallow me whole, anything to escape this existence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I sprang up in my bed, consumed by a state of unparalleled panic, furiously sweating and terrified of what had just occurred. This curse only releasing me now that all was left was helplessness. It was all only in my mind, but that did not prevent the fear being just as real. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The empty wall now had a wardrobe and desk occupying it. Instantly obvious to me that this is what should&#39;ve been there, why could I not construct these thoughts in my mind before. My mind, my most personal place, the most secure, had been more disconnected than ever before. Terrified in my own familiarity. Terrified in my own comfort. I felt impure in my own body, my own thoughts had been strangled, invaded by a unknown empty. Forced to endure this endless uncalculated uncertainty. How can I willing embrace sleep after this?</span></p></body></html>
