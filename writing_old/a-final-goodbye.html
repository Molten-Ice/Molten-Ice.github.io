<h1>A Final Goodbye</h1>
<blockquote>

<p>
As your hand trails along mine, brushing through my fingertips before finally breaking contact, I know this will be our final goodbye. As I step away into the airport terminal a cascading wave of emotions consumes me, an entire summer of memories, condensed and relived, in a single moment. It feels like a scene from a movie, over dramatic and extreme, but this time it isn't distant on my screen, instead, now something too personal, penetrating my heart to its core. How can something so complicated, so intimate yet distance, be concluded in a single instant?
<br><br>
My brains fogs with conflict, the deepest sadness, combined with the greatest relief, finally free. You torture my mind, plague my thoughts. Lead more on more than I knew was possible, endless flirtation, yet refusal to admit any of it. You keep me close, then push me away, expecting me to be perfecting accepting of your unjustified actions.
<br><br>
In your mind you already ended any friendship days ago, pushing me away, attempting to pretend I don't exist, playing with my emotions as if they have no value to you, even after all this time. Trawling me along, only allowing me to gasp for air and barely stay afloat, how can you think that was acceptable. At our our final hug you final succumb to your true emotions, any facade in that instantly clearly seen through, as you instantly breakdown, it is obvious, even to any ignorant bystander, how you feel. 
<br><br>
You project your insecurities onto me, a situation which always gravitates towards me, no matter how hard I try to avoid it. You write me a final goodbye letter, call me by all the nicknames you have for me, apologise for every time you hurt me. Wounds which a simple sentence or apology cannot heal, still remaining persistent to this day, forever tainting my impression of love, making me unwilling to try again. 
<br><br>
You are something I want to forget, something I have since forgotten. But the damage remain enduring, the distorted and damaged perception of love resurfacing whenever I tempt love again.
<br><br>
As I gaze out the plane's window I see the most perfect sunset, layered shades of vibrant orange and red expanding across the horizon. Obscured until now, but now finally making their mark, emerging with unwavering confidence. Wanting to forever immortalise this moment I take a photo with DSLR camera, capturing its depth; the symbolization of a new beginning, the never ending cycle of the sunrise showing it is never too late to start over.
